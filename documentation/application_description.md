#Application description

Catstagram is an application for sharing cat profiles.

**Visitors** are able to see the front page without logging in.

**Users** can create new cat profiles, modify/delete old ones and upload/remove pictures of a cat on the cat's profile page. They can also "Follow" someone else's cat and "Like" someone else's cat pictures. Users can only edit things inside their own profile.

**Admins** can delete profiles and pictures in general.

After logging in the user is redirected to the front page that shows TOP-10 most followed cats. There are links that can be clicked in order to visit cats' pages. From there it is possible to navigate to the *'user profile page'* or *'logout'*.

1. On the **user profile page** there are some minor information about the user (like nickname, gender, age, home town etc.) and links to his or her *'cat profile pages'*.

    On each **cat profile page** there are information and pictures about the cat. Each picture shows how many users have liked the picture. Each profile shows how many users have followed the cat. There is a possibility to see who have liked and followed. There is a list of links to these profiles.

2. A user may click **logout** and will be redirected to the front page, but will have to log in again in order to access the site.
